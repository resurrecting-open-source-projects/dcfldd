.SH NAME
dcfldd \- manual page for dcfldd (dcfldd) 1.2.3
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dcfldd
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Copy a file, converting and formatting according to the options.
.TP
bs=BYTES
force ibs=BYTES and obs=BYTES
.TP
cbs=BYTES
convert BYTES bytes at a time
.TP
conv=KEYWORDS
convert the file as per the comma separated keyword list
.TP
count=BLOCKS
copy only BLOCKS input blocks
.TP
ibs=BYTES
read BYTES bytes at a time
.TP
if=FILE
read from FILE instead of stdin
.TP
obs=BYTES
write BYTES bytes at a time
.TP
of=FILE
write to FILE instead of stdout
.IP
NOTE: of=FILE may be used several times to write
.IP
output to multiple files simultaneously
.TP
seek=BLOCKS
skip BLOCKS obs\-sized blocks at start of output
.TP
skip=BLOCKS
skip BLOCKS ibs\-sized blocks at start of input
.TP
pattern=HEX
use the specified binary pattern as input
.TP
textpattern=TEXT
use repeating TEXT as input
.TP
hashwindow=BYTES
perform a hash on every BYTES amount of data
.TP
hash=NAME
either md5, sha1, sha256, sha384 or sha512
.IP
default algorithm is md5. To select multiple
algorithms to run simultaneously enter the names
in a comma separated list
.TP
hashlog=FILE
send MD5 hash output to FILE instead of stderr
.IP
if you are using multiple hash algorithms you
can send each to a seperate file using the
convention ALGORITHMlog=FILE, for example
md5log=FILE1, sha1log=FILE2, etc.
.TP
status=[on|off]
display a continual status message on stderr
.IP
default state is "on"
.TP
sizeprobe=[if|of]
determine the size of the input or output file
.IP
for use with status messages. (this option
gives you a percentage indicator)
WARNING: do not use this option against a
.IP
tape device.
.TP
split=BYTES
write every BYTES amount of data to a new file
.IP
This operation applies to any of=FILE that follows
.TP
splitformat=TEXT
the file extension format for split operation.
.IP
you may use any number of 'a' or 'n' in any combo
the default format is "nnn"
NOTE: The split and splitformat options take effect
.IP
only for output files specified AFTER these
options appear in the command line.  Likewise,
you may specify these several times for
for different output files within the same
command line. you may use as many digits in
any combination you would like.
(e.g. "anaannnaana" would be valid, but
.IP
quite insane)
.TP
vf=FILE
verify that FILE matches the specified input
.TP
verifylog=FILE
send verify results to FILE instead of stderr
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
BLOCKS and BYTES may be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes:
xM M, c 1, w 2, b 512, kD 1000, k 1024, MD 1,000,000, M 1,048,576,
GD 1,000,000,000, G 1,073,741,824, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.
Each KEYWORD may be:
.TP
ascii
from EBCDIC to ASCII
.TP
ebcdic
from ASCII to EBCDIC
.TP
ibm
from ASCII to alternated EBCDIC
.TP
block
pad newline\-terminated records with spaces to cbs\-size
.TP
unblock
replace trailing spaces in cbs\-size records with newline
.TP
lcase
change upper case to lower case
.TP
notrunc
do not truncate the output file
.TP
ucase
change lower case to upper case
.TP
swab
swap every pair of input bytes
.TP
noerror
continue after read errors
.TP
sync
pad every input block with NULs to ibs\-size; when used
with block or unblock, pad with spaces rather than NULs
