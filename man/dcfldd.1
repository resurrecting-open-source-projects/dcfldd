.SH DESCRIPTION
Copy a file, converting and formatting according to the options.
.PP
\fBdcfldd\fP was initially developed at Department of Defense Computer Forensics Lab (DCFL). This tool is
based on the dd program with the following additional features:
.IP \(bu 3
Hashing on-the-fly: \fBdcfldd\fP can hash the input data as it is being transferred, helping to ensure
data integrity.
.IP \(bu 3
Status output: \fBdcfldd\fP can update the user of its progress in terms of the amount of data transferred
and how much longer operation will take.
.IP \(bu 3
Flexible disk wipes: \fBdcfldd\fP can be used to wipe disks quickly and with a known pattern if desired.
.IP \(bu 3
Image/wipe verify: \fBdcfldd\fP can verify that a target drive is a bit-for-bit match of the specified
input file or pattern.
.IP \(bu 3
Multiple outputs: \fBdcfldd\fP can output to multiple files or disks at the same time.
.IP \(bu 3
Split output: \fBdcfldd\fP can split output to multiple files with more configurability than the split
command.
.IP \(bu 3
Piped output and logs: \fBdcfldd\fP can send all its log data and output to commands as well as files
natively.
.IP \(bu 3
When dd uses a default block size (bs, ibs, obs) of 512 bytes, \fBdcfldd\fP uses 32768 bytes (32 KiB)
which is HUGELY more efficient.
.IP \(bu 3
The following options are present in \fBdcfldd\fP but not in dd: ALGORITHMlog:, errlog, hash, hashconv,
hashformat, hashlog, hashlog:, hashwindow, limit, of:, pattern, sizeprobe, split, splitformat,
statusinterval, textpattern, totalhashformat, verifylog, verifylog:, vf.
.PP
\fBdcfldd\fP supports the following letters to specify amount of data: k for kilo, M for Mega, G for Giga,
T for Tera, P for Peta, E for Exa, Z for Zetta and Y for Yotta. E.g. 10M is equal to 10 MiB. See
the BLOCKS AND BYTES section to get other possibilities.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
bs=BYTES
Force ibs=BYTES and obs=BYTES. Default value is 32768 (32KiB). See BLOCKS AND BYTES
section. Warning: the block size will be created in RAM. Make sure you have sufficient
amount of free memory.
.TP
.B
cbs=BYTES
Convert BYTES bytes at a time. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
.TP
.B
conv=KEYWORDS
Convert the file as per the comma separated keyword list.
.TP
.B
count=BLOCKS
Copy only BLOCKS input blocks. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
.TP
.B
limit=BYTES
Similar to count but using BYTES instead of BLOCKS. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
.TP
.B
ibs=BYTES
Read BYTES bytes at a time. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
.TP
.B
if=FILE
Read from FILE instead of stdin. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
.TP
.B
obs=BYTES
Write BYTES bytes at a time. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
.TP
.B
of=FILE
Write to FILE instead of stdout. NOTE: of=FILE may be used several times to write
output to multiple files simultaneously.
.TP
.B
of:=COMMAND
Exec and write output to process COMMAND.
.TP
.B
seek=BLOCKS
Skip BLOCKS obs-sized blocks at start of output. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
.TP
.B
skip=BLOCKS
Skip BLOCKS ibs-sized blocks at start of input. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
.TP
.B
pattern=HEX
Use the specified binary pattern as input. You can use a byte only.
.TP
.B
textpattern=TEXT
Use repeating TEXT as input. You can use a character only.
.TP
.B
errlog=FILE
Send error messages to FILE as well as stderr.
.TP
.B
hash=NAME
Do hash calculation in parallel with the disk reading. Either md5, sha1, sha256, sha384
or sha512 can be used. Default algorithm is md5. To select multiple algorithms to run
simultaneously enter the names in a comma separated list.
.TP
.B
hashlog=FILE
Send hash output to FILE instead of stderr. If you are using multiple hash
algorithms you can send each to a separate file using the convention ALGORITHMlog=FILE,
for example md5log=FILE1, sha1log=FILE2, etc.
.TP
.B
hashwindow=BYTES
Perform a hash on every BYTES amount of data. The partial results will be shown in
screen. The default hash is md5 but you can use hash= option to choose other.
.TP
.B
hashlog:=COMMAND
Exec and write hashlog to process COMMAND.
.TP
.B
ALGORITHMlog:=COMMAND
Also works in the same fashion of hashlog:=COMMAND.
.TP
.B
hashconv=[before|after]
Perform the hashing before or after the conversions.
.TP
.B
hashformat=FORMAT
Display each hashwindow according to FORMAT the hash format mini-language is
described below.
.TP
.B
totalhashformat=FORMAT
Display the total hash value according to FORMAT the hash format mini-language is
described below.
.TP
.B
status=[on|off]
Display a continual status message on stderr. Default state is "on".
.TP
.B
statusinterval=N
Update the status message every N blocks. Default value is 256.
.TP
.B
sizeprobe=[if|of|BYTES]
Determine the size of the input or output file or an amount of BYTES for use
with status messages. This option gives you a percentage indicator around the
sizeprobe value. WARNING: do not use this option against a tape device. (see
BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
.TP
.B
split=BYTES
Write every BYTES amount of data to a new file. This operation applies to any
of=FILE that follows (split= must be put before of=). (see BLOCKS AND BYTES
section)
.TP
.B
splitformat=[TEXT|MAC|WIN]
The file extension format for split operation. You may use "a" for letters
and "n" for numbers. If you use annn, an extension started as a000 will be
appended; the last possible extension for this format will be z999.
splitformat=an will provide a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, b0, b1,
b2, b3\.\.\. If nothing is specified the default format is "nnn". NOTE: the split
and splitformat options take effect only for output files (option of=) specified
AFTER these options appear in the command line (e.g. split=50M splitformat=annn
of=/tmp/test.iso).
Likewise, you may specify it several times for different output files within
the same command line. You may use as many digits in any combination you would
like. E.g. "anaannnaana" would be valid, but a quite insane (see BLOCKS AND BYTES
section).
Other possible approach is MAC. If "MAC" is used, a suffix dmg and several
dmgpart will be appended. In other words, it will generate a partial disk image
file, used by the Mac OS X operating system. dmgpart files are usually provided
with a corresponding dmg file, which is the master file for the split archive.
If dmg is opened in Mac OS X, all dmgpart will be read too. The last option is
WIN, which will automatically output file naming of foo.001, foo.002, \.\.\.,
foo.999, foo.1000, \.\.\..
.TP
.B
vf=FILE
Verify that FILE matches the specified input.
.TP
.B
verifylog=FILE
Send verify results to FILE instead of stderr.
.TP
.B
verifylog:=COMMAND
Exec and write verify results to process COMMAND.
.TP
.B
\fB--help\fP
Display a help page and exit.
.TP

.fam T
.fi
The FORMAT structure accepts the following escape codes:

.SH EXAMPLES

Each following line will create a 100 MiB file containing zeros:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ dcfldd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=1M count=100
    $ dcfldd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=100M count=1
    $ dcfldd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=50M count=2
    $ dcfldd if=/dev/zero of=test limit=100M

.fam T
.fi
To create a copy (forensics image) from a disk called /dev/sdb inside a file, using input/output blocks
of 4096 bytes (4 KiB) instead of 32 KiB (default):
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ dcfldd if=/dev/sdb bs=4096 of=sdb.img

.fam T
.fi
As the last example, plus calculating MD5 and SHA256 hashes, putting the results inside sdb.md5 and
sdb.sha256. It is very useful for forensics works because the hashes will be processed in real time,
avoiding a waste of time to make something as 'dd + md5 + sha256'. Considering that I/O disk is very
slow and RAM is very fast, the hashes will be calculated, bit per bit in memory, when the next portion
of the disk is read. When all disk was read, all hashes are now ready.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ dcfldd if=/dev/sdb bs=4096 hash=md5,sha256 md5log=sdb.md5 sha256log=sdb.sha256 of=sdb.img

.fam T
.fi
To validate the image file against the original source:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ dcfldd if=/dev/sdb vf=sdb.img

.fam T
.fi
Splitting the image in 500 MiB slices, using the default bs value (32 KiB). Note that split= must be
put before of= to work:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ dcfldd if=/dev/sdb split=500M of=sdb.img

.fam T
.fi
At the last example, using from a0000 up to z9999 as suffix for each split file:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ dcfldd if=/dev/sdb split=500M splitformat=annnn of=sdb.img

.fam T
.fi
Now, \fBdcfldd\fP will work byte per byte (bs=1) and will hop 1056087439 bytes. After this, \fBdcfldd\fP will collect
200000 bytes and write the results to a file called airplane.jpg.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ dcfldd if=/dev/sda3 bs=1 skip=1056087439 count=200000 of=airplane.jpg

.fam T
.fi
In the last example, the same result could be obtained using "limit" instead of "count". The main
difference is that count uses 200000*bs and limit uses 200000 bytes (regardless of the value declared in
bs option):
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ dcfldd if=/dev/sda3 bs=1 skip=1056087439 limit=200000 of=airplane.jpg

.fam T
.fi
To write something inside a file, you can use seek. Suppose you want to write a message from a file called
message.txt inside a file called target.iso, hopping 200000 bytes from start of file:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ dcfldd if=message.txt bs=1 seek=200000 of=target.iso

.fam T
.fi
\fBdcfldd\fP also can send a result to be processed by an external command:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ dcfldd if=text.txt  of:="cat | sort -u"

.fam T
.fi
To convert a file from ASCII to EBCDIC:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ dcfldd if=text.asc conv=ebcdic of=text.ebcdic

.fam T
.fi
To convert a file from EBCDIC to ASCII:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ dcfldd if=text.ebcdic conv=ascii of=text.asc

.fam T
.fi
