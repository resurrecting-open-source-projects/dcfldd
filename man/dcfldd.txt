NAME
  dcfldd - enhanced version of dd for forensics and security

SYNOPSIS
  dcfldd [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
  Copy a file, converting and formatting according to the options.

  dcfldd was initially developed at Department of Defense Computer Forensics Lab (DCFL). This tool is
  based on the dd program with the following additional features:

  - Hashing on-the-fly: dcfldd can hash the input data as it is being transferred, helping to ensure
    data integrity.
  - Status output: dcfldd can update the user of its progress in terms of the amount of data transferred
    and how much longer operation will take.
  - Flexible disk wipes: dcfldd can be used to wipe disks quickly and with a known pattern if desired.
  - Image/wipe verify: dcfldd can verify that a target drive is a bit-for-bit match of the specified
    input file or pattern.
  - Multiple outputs: dcfldd can output to multiple files or disks at the same time.
  - Split output: dcfldd can split output to multiple files with more configurability than the split
    command.
  - Piped output and logs: dcfldd can send all its log data and output to commands as well as files
    natively.
  - When dd uses a default block size (bs, ibs, obs) of 512 bytes, dcfldd uses 32768 bytes (32 KiB)
    which is HUGELY more efficient.
  - The following options are present in dcfldd but not in dd: ALGORITHMlog:, errlog, hash, hashconv,
    hashformat, hashlog, hashlog:, hashwindow, limit, of:, pattern, sizeprobe, split, splitformat,
    statusinterval, textpattern, totalhashformat, verifylog, verifylog:, vf.

  dcfldd supports the following letters to specify amount of data: k for kilo, M for Mega, G for Giga,
  T for Tera, P for Peta, E for Exa, Z for Zetta and Y for Yotta. E.g. 10M is equal to 10 MiB. See
  the BLOCKS AND BYTES section to get other possibilities.

OPTIONS
  bs=BYTES          Force ibs=BYTES and obs=BYTES. Default value is 32768 (32KiB). See BLOCKS AND BYTES
                    section. Warning: the block size will be created in RAM. Make sure you have sufficient
                    amount of free memory.
  cbs=BYTES         Convert BYTES bytes at a time. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
  conv=KEYWORDS     Convert the file as per the comma separated keyword list.
  count=BLOCKS      Copy only BLOCKS input blocks. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
  limit=BYTES       Similar to count but using BYTES instead of BLOCKS. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
  ibs=BYTES         Read BYTES bytes at a time. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
  if=FILE           Read from FILE instead of stdin. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
  obs=BYTES         Write BYTES bytes at a time. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
  of=FILE           Write to FILE instead of stdout. NOTE: of=FILE may be used several times to write
                    output to multiple files simultaneously.
  of:=COMMAND       Exec and write output to process COMMAND.
  seek=BLOCKS       Skip BLOCKS obs-sized blocks at start of output. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
  skip=BLOCKS       Skip BLOCKS ibs-sized blocks at start of input. (see BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
  pattern=HEX       Use the specified binary pattern as input. You can use a byte only.
  textpattern=TEXT  Use repeating TEXT as input. You can use a character only.
  errlog=FILE       Send error messages to FILE as well as stderr.
  hash=NAME         Do hash calculation in parallel with the disk reading. Either md5, sha1, sha256, sha384
                    or sha512 can be used. Default algorithm is md5. To select multiple algorithms to run
                    simultaneously enter the names in a comma separated list.
  hashlog=FILE      Send hash output to FILE instead of stderr. If you are using multiple hash
                    algorithms you can send each to a separate file using the convention ALGORITHMlog=FILE,
                    for example md5log=FILE1, sha1log=FILE2, etc.
  hashwindow=BYTES  Perform a hash on every BYTES amount of data. The partial results will be shown in
                    screen. The default hash is md5 but you can use hash= option to choose other.
  hashlog:=COMMAND  Exec and write hashlog to process COMMAND.
  ALGORITHMlog:=COMMAND    Also works in the same fashion of hashlog:=COMMAND.
  hashconv=[before|after]  Perform the hashing before or after the conversions.
  hashformat=FORMAT        Display each hashwindow according to FORMAT the hash format mini-language is
                           described below.
  totalhashformat=FORMAT   Display the total hash value according to FORMAT the hash format mini-language is
                           described below.
  status=[on|off]          Display a continual status message on stderr. Default state is "on".
  statusinterval=N         Update the status message every N blocks. Default value is 256.
  sizeprobe=[if|of|BYTES]  Determine the size of the input or output file or an amount of BYTES for use
                           with status messages. This option gives you a percentage indicator around the
                           sizeprobe value. WARNING: do not use this option against a tape device. (see
                           BLOCKS AND BYTES section)
  split=BYTES              Write every BYTES amount of data to a new file. This operation applies to any
                           of=FILE that follows (split= must be put before of=). (see BLOCKS AND BYTES
                           section)
  splitformat=[TEXT|MAC|WIN]   The file extension format for split operation. You may use "a" for letters
                           and "n" for numbers. If you use annn, an extension started as a000 will be
                           appended; the last possible extension for this format will be z999.
                           splitformat=an will provide a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, b0, b1,
                           b2, b3... If nothing is specified the default format is "nnn". NOTE: the split
                           and splitformat options take effect only for output files (option of=) specified
                           AFTER these options appear in the command line (e.g. split=50M splitformat=annn
                           of=/tmp/test.iso).
                           Likewise, you may specify it several times for different output files within
                           the same command line. You may use as many digits in any combination you would
                           like. E.g. "anaannnaana" would be valid, but a quite insane (see BLOCKS AND BYTES
                           section).
                           Other possible approach is MAC. If "MAC" is used, a suffix dmg and several
                           dmgpart will be appended. In other words, it will generate a partial disk image
                           file, used by the Mac OS X operating system. dmgpart files are usually provided
                           with a corresponding dmg file, which is the master file for the split archive.
                           If dmg is opened in Mac OS X, all dmgpart will be read too. The last option is
                           WIN, which will automatically output file naming of foo.001, foo.002, ...,
                           foo.999, foo.1000, ....
  vf=FILE                  Verify that FILE matches the specified input.
  verifylog=FILE           Send verify results to FILE instead of stderr.
  verifylog:=COMMAND       Exec and write verify results to process COMMAND.
  diffwr=[on|off]          Write only to output if destination block content is differs. This operation 
                           applies to any of=FILE that follows (diffwr= must be put before of=)
  --help                   Display a help page and exit.
  --version                Output version information and exit.

BLOCKS AND BYTES
  BLOCKS and BYTES may be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes: xM M, c 1, w 2, b 512, kD 1000,
  k 1024, MD 1,000,000, M 1,048,576, GD 1,000,000,000, G 1,073,741,824, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.

KEYWORDS
  Each KEYWORD may be:

  ascii  From EBCDIC to ASCII.
  ebcdic  From ASCII to EBCDIC.
  ibm     From ASCII to alternated EBCDIC.
  block   Pad newline-terminated records with spaces to cbs-size.
  unblock  Replace trailing spaces in cbs-size records with newline.
  lcase    Change upper case to lower case.
  notrunc  Do not truncate the output file.
  ucase    Change lower case to upper case.
  swab     Swap every pair of input bytes.
  noerror  Continue after read errors.
  sync     Pad every input block with NULs to ibs-size. When used with block or unblock, pad with spaces
           rather than NULs.

FORMAT
  The structure of FORMAT may contain any valid text and special variables. The built-in variables are the
  following format: #variable_name#. To pass FORMAT strings to the program from a command line, it may be
  necessary to surround your FORMAT strings with "quotes."  The built-in variables are listed below:

  window_start  The beginning byte offset of the hashwindow.
  window_end    The ending byte offset of the hashwindow.
  block_start   The beginning block (by input blocksize) of the window.
  block_end     The ending block (by input blocksize) of the hash window.
  hash          The hash value.
  algorithm     The name of the hash algorithm.

  For example, the default FORMAT for hashformat and totalhashformat are:

    hashformat="#window_start# - #window_end#: #hash#" totalhashformat="Total (#algorithm#): #hash#"

  The FORMAT structure accepts the following escape codes:

  \\n  Newline
  \\t  Tab
  \\r  Carriage return
  \\   Insert the '\\' character
  ##   Insert the '#' character as text, not a variable

EXAMPLES

  Each following line will create a 100 MiB file containing zeros:

    $ dcfldd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=1M count=100
    $ dcfldd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=100M count=1
    $ dcfldd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=50M count=2
    $ dcfldd if=/dev/zero of=test limit=100M

  To create a copy (forensics image) from a disk called /dev/sdb inside a file, using input/output blocks
  of 4096 bytes (4 KiB) instead of 32 KiB (default):

    $ dcfldd if=/dev/sdb bs=4096 of=sdb.img

  As the last example, plus calculating MD5 and SHA256 hashes, putting the results inside sdb.md5 and
  sdb.sha256. It is very useful for forensics works because the hashes will be processed in real time,
  avoiding a waste of time to make something as 'dd + md5 + sha256'. Considering that I/O disk is very
  slow and RAM is very fast, the hashes will be calculated, bit per bit in memory, when the next portion
  of the disk is read. When all disk was read, all hashes are now ready.

    $ dcfldd if=/dev/sdb bs=4096 hash=md5,sha256 md5log=sdb.md5 sha256log=sdb.sha256 of=sdb.img

  To validate the image file against the original source:

    $ dcfldd if=/dev/sdb vf=sdb.img

  Splitting the image in 500 MiB slices, using the default bs value (32 KiB). Note that split= must be
  put before of= to work:

    $ dcfldd if=/dev/sdb split=500M of=sdb.img

  At the last example, using from a0000 up to z9999 as suffix for each split file:

    $ dcfldd if=/dev/sdb split=500M splitformat=annnn of=sdb.img

  Now, dcfldd will work byte per byte (bs=1) and will hop 1056087439 bytes. After this, dcfldd will collect
  200000 bytes and write the results to a file called airplane.jpg.

    $ dcfldd if=/dev/sda3 bs=1 skip=1056087439 count=200000 of=airplane.jpg

  In the last example, the same result could be obtained using "limit" instead of "count". The main
  difference is that count uses 200000*bs and limit uses 200000 bytes (regardless of the value declared in
  bs option):

    $ dcfldd if=/dev/sda3 bs=1 skip=1056087439 limit=200000 of=airplane.jpg

  To write something inside a file, you can use seek. Suppose you want to write a message from a file called
  message.txt inside a file called target.iso, hopping 200000 bytes from start of file:

    $ dcfldd if=message.txt bs=1 seek=200000 of=target.iso

  dcfldd also can send a result to be processed by an external command:

    $ dcfldd if=text.txt  of:="cat | sort -u"

  To convert a file from ASCII to EBCDIC:

    $ dcfldd if=text.asc conv=ebcdic of=text.ebcdic

  To convert a file from EBCDIC to ASCII:

    $ dcfldd if=text.ebcdic conv=ascii of=text.asc
