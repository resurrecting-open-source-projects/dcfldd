dcfldd is a modified version of GNU dd.  The major features added
are hashing, fast disk wiping (through patterns) and status output.

dcfldd was originally created by Nicholas Harbour from the
DoD Computer Forensics Laboratory (DCFL).  Nick Harbour still maintains
the package, although he is no longer affiliated with the DCFL.
