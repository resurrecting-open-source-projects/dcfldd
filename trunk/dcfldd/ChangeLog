	* Updated the include process in dcfldd.h to allow for
	  the proper use of the detected environment. Also added
	  AC_GNU_SOURCE, AC_SYS_LARGEFILE, and checks for time.h 
	  to the configure script. These eliminate some redundant
	  includes in dcfldd.h and make sure we've defined O_DIRECT
	  if it's available.
