Changes from version 1.3.4-1:
	- Added 'd' option to splitformat to create suffixes starting
	  at .001 instead of .000
	- Added "log" mode to combine hashlog and errlog files.
	  This mode will append existing files, not overwrite them.
	- Created option to reset the default block size to 512 bytes 
	  at compile time. (./configure CFLAGS="-DDEFAULT_BLOCKSIZE=512")
	- In the final output, added the number of bytes in/out in 
	  addition to the number of records.
	- Added conv=direct to allow for direct input mode (on systems 
	  that support such a mode).
	
Changes from version 1.2.2:
	- Added ability to write to multiple output files.
	- Added split capability with the "split=" and "splitformat=" switches.
	- Converts "if=/dev/zero" to "pattern=00" to force efficiency.
	- Fixed a few bugs with verify.
