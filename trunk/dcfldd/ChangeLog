	* Updated documentation to include note on 64-bit Linux
	  and compiler optimization flags.
	* Modified "close" call in open_split function. We need to
	  close the file handle used by each split file before 
	  opening the next.

	* Fixed definition of C_DIRECT in dcfldd.h from a duplicate
	  of C_TWOBUFS to its own unique value. This could cause a 
	  crash on some 64-bit platforms.

	* Updated the include process in dcfldd.h to allow for
	  the proper use of the detected environment. Also added
	  AC_GNU_SOURCE, AC_SYS_LARGEFILE, and checks for time.h 
	  to the configure script. These eliminate some redundant
	  includes in dcfldd.h and make sure we've defined O_DIRECT
	  if it's available.
