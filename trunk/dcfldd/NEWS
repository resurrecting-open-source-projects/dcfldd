** Changes in version 1.4 (RBF DATE)

* New Features:

	Added 'd' option to splitformat parameter to create file 
	suffixes starting with .001 instead of .000

	Added "log" mode to combine hashlog and errlog files.
	This mode will append existing files, not overwrite them.

	at compilation time. Although this existed in previous

	due to too many open file handles.
