This is dcfldd, an enhanced version of GNU dd with features useful for
forensics and security. Based on the dd program found in the GNU
Coreutils package, dcfldd can also compute hashes on the fly,
produce a status message while imaging, wipe drives easily, output
to multiple files, split the output, and pipe its output to
different file types.

See the file NEWS for a list of changes between releases.

See the file COPYING for information about the licensing for this program. 

See the file INSTALL for (generic) compilation and installation
instructions. Here's the short version:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Note that you must be normally root to install to the default location.
The sudo command is helpful for doing so. You can specify an alternate
installation location using the --prefix option to the configure script.
For example, to install to /home/foo/bin, use:

$ ./configure --prefix=/home/foo

Note that this version of the program uses a default block size of 32KB,
or 32,768 bytes. You can change this value when you install the program. 
For example, to the use traditional default block size of 512 bytes:

$ ./configure CFLAGS="-DDEFAULT_BLOCKSIZE=512" 

Please note that changing the CFLAGS variable clobbers the default
value. This is normally not a problem execpt on 64 bit Linux platforms,
where compiler optimizations appear to be required. On these systems,
please make sure to include compiler optimizations, like this:

$ ./configure CFLAGS="-DDEFAULT_BLOCKSIZE=512 -O3"





dcfldd was originally created by Nicholas Harbour from the
DoD Computer Forensics Laboratory (DCFL).  Nick Harbour still maintains
the package, although he is no longer affiliated with the DCFL.
